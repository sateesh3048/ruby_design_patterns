# Singleton Pattern:

Singleton is a creational design pattern **that restricts instantiation of a class to only one instance** that is globally available. 
It is useful when you need **that instance to be accessible in different parts of the application, usually for logging 
functionality, communication with external systems, database access**, etc.
