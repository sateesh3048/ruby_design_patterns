## Structural Design Patterns 

Structural Patterns describes **how objects relate to each other**.

### What is Structural Design Pattern?

Structural design pattern **is a blueprint of how different objects and classes are combined together to form a bigger structure for achieving multiple goals altogether**. The patterns in structural designs **show how unique pieces of a system can be combined together in an extensible and flexible manner**. So, with the help structural design pattern **we can target and change a specific parts of the structure without changing the entire structure**.

# 10 Design patterns explained in single line
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv-_1er1mWI

- Singleton (Creational)
    Object that can only be instantiated once.
    Use case: Settings

- Prototype (Creational)
    Fancy word for "clone".
    Create clone object instead of extending object.

- Builder (Creational)
    Create object with methods instead of constructor.
    Examples: 
        JQuery.

- Factory (Creational)
    Instead of using a new keyword to instantiate and object you use a function or method to do it for you.
    Use case: Cross platform app - Conditional checking to determine which button to show.

- Facade (Structural)
     A simplified API to hide low level details in your code base.
    Use case: Create facade class that contain the low level systems as dependencies which then simplifies their operation.
    Examples: 
        JQuery.

- Proxy (Structural)
    Fancy word for "substitue".
    Replace target object with a proxy.
    Examples: 
        Vue's reactivity system.

- Iterator (Behavioral)
    Traverse through a collection of objects. for loop.

- Observer (Behavioral)
    Many objects subscribe to events that are broadcast from another object.
    one-to-many relationship.
    Loop that unfolds over the dimension of time.

- Mediator (Behavioral)
    Is like a middle man or broker.
    Examples: 
        1. Air traffic controller that sits between the runways & airplains to provide coordination & communication .
        2. Middleware

- State (Behavioral)

    Object behaves differently based on a finite amount of states.
    Examples:
        Finite State Machines
